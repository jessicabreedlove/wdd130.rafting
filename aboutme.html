      I am happy to be here! Coding is one of those incredible things that can be used by anyone! It's surprisingly creative, and makes me feel like a super hero. Just think, back in the day you often had to be a big burley man to build something. Not with coding! Just some keystrokes and I can build amazing things!

      I am a tech mom and really appreciate resources that are available to help me on my journey. I also love helping other women on their pathway to success! I am grateful to be a wife, mother, and a student!

      My hobbies include reading, riding my bike, and group fitness classes at my local rec center. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson. I am a social butterfky and love getting to know people. It's gonna be a great semester!
